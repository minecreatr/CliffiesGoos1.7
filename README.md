CliffiesGoos
============

"From simple rules, emerges complex creations"  Actually just goos that spread onto other blocks, but they have some odd emergent stuff.

This is a weird mod I came up with that adds some taint-like/goo-type blocks to the game.  Currently only a simple tier 0 goo and anti-taint walls.

Tier 0 goo: Spreads onto nearby blocks that aren't bedrock or a anti-taint wall.

Tier 1 goo: More deadly tier 0 goo.

Tier 2 goo: Gas of doom.

Tier 3 goo: Very bad goo that starts the end of the world.

Force fields: Nice way to keep out tier 2/3 goo.

Air locks: For easy passing through your epic force field base.

Anti taint walls: Derpy sounding walls to keep out tier 0/1 taint.

Anti taint wall: Keeps out goos.

Compiling: (TODO)
